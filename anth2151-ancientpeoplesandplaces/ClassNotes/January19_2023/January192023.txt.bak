The origins of modern humans

	Our focus of the course is for early homo sapians. The coverage for today is mainly europe and asia. Climate estimates are from cores taken in iceland glaciers. 
	When cold and dry, water is a lot heavier. Cores taken from glaciers weigh more when the water frozen at the time when water is cold. Interglacial conditions collide with glacial conditions. 
	More biomass is present during interglacial conditions because of the higher presence of forests and other areas of high biodiversity. 

	
	Who were neanderthals?
		Once though to be a direct ancestor to modern humans, but are recognized now to officially be a distant cousin in the evolutionary tree. They diverged from modern humans around 600,000 years ago. 
		A lot of evidence is brought by genetic analysis; the analysis of genome structures. 

		One group of archaic homo sapiens. Made famous by the 1856 discovery in the Neander Valley and the poor reconstruction of the La Chapelle-aux-Saints specimen by Marcellin Boule in the early 20th 
		century. 

	The site of Vindija, Croatia yielded the bones of many Neanderthals. Cell nucleus, Mitochrondira within the nucleus, Chromosomes, DNA within the chromosomes all come from bone samples of Neanderthals. 
	The Neanderthal genome is a very important aspect of our modern knowledge. 
	Sequences of Neanderthal DNA that have been recovered are significantly different from the DNA sequence of living humans. 
	Indicates that the Neanderthal and human lineages diverged somewhere between 740,000 and 320,000 years ago. 
	Numerous healed skull and upper limb fractures demonstrate that life was tough in the middle Palaeolithic. 
	Neanderthals had to undergo a tempature change of 10.5 degrees celsius within a span of 50 years after the last ice age. They developed to be adapatable to many different climates and be able to endure
	different temperatures. 
	
	
	Neanderthal survival strategy
		Under prevailing climate conditions, mostly food resources were of animals because animals could adapt to different temperatures and climates. Very little plant foods were at hand.
		They hunted medium- and big-sized mammals (e.g. horses, deer, bison, wild cattle, etc.). Only small groups of hunting groups could be formed, therefore women and children likely joined the hunt. 
		Their energy requirements and challenges they faced led to hunting as a preferred strategy. 
		

		Conchoidal fracture 
			Brittle 'cryptocrystalline' rocks, fracture in a prectable, uniform manner. They break at an agle of 100 degrees from the point of impact. Change the angle of the percussive blow and the shape of the chipped flake
			will change. 

			The instant the blow strikes the surface its force is transmitted into a cone radiating at about 100 degrees. This cone (Hertzian cone) determines at what angle you must strike a blow to remove a particular chunk of 
			stone. Striking the blow correctly aligns the edge of the cone with the flake you want to remove. 

		Flint knapper is the Neanderthal who finds pieces of stone which can be utilized. Next, he forms a special chipping platform for the rock. The point of percussion is where the flint knapper hit the stone on the chipping
		platform to produce a specific shape on the stone. Levallois technique is when you carefully prepare a core of rock, and detach flakes. Levallois core and flake. 


	Neanderthals social behaviour can be viewed as a 'social safety net' (altruism). They served to protect and care for disabled or otherwise vulnerable members of the group. Other reasons;
	Depth of the social life is noted in appearance of deliberate graves that demonstrate burial ritual, burial offerings, and even inclusion of flowers in the grave.
	Cut marks and missing heads have been interpreted as evidence of violence or cannibalism. However, it is more likely that this reflects some part of a burtian ritual (ritual defleshing, skulls being collected and reburied, 
	etc.). At the site of Kebara (65,000 BCE) in Israel, the remains of a Neanderthal indicate purposeful burial.

	At a cave called Shanidar in Iraq, 1950's exacavations revealed the presence of burial sites. These graves were accompanied by plants like white and yellow flowers. 
	Perforated shells found in sediments at Cueva de Ios Aviones are between 115,000 and 150,000 years old. 

	Homosapiens and Neanderthals last shared a common ancestor, known as ...

	
	In central Asia, there are the 'Denisovans'. Altai mountains of remote Siberia. Discoveries in the cave confirmed that the Denisovans were a lineage distinct from modern humans. The entire genome was extracted from a 
	tooth and finger bone. 
	
	160,000 year old Denisovan mandible and molars. They were adapted to high altitudes and very cold temperatures. Additionally, remainds have also been discovered in Laos. Because of genome sequence, anthroplogists think
	Denisovan skull was wider than the Neanderthals, appearing to have no chin.

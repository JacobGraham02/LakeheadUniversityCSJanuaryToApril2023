Kaiser&Forenbaher 2012:
	Stalagmites hanging from the ceiling and stalagmatic crust covering surfaces, particularly when undisturbed, indicated no living thing had been there for a long period of time. Nakovana cave was an undisturbed sanctuary cave 
site. Sediment is filtered using a sieve and a high-pressure water gun. In the Nakovana cave, the sieve holes were 3mm squared and was aided with a high-pressure water gun to separate sediment and important archeological material. 
The cave mainly contained highly-structured evidence a ritual took place here. The hellenistic finewears in this cave suggested there were multiple different sources they came from. The large piece of stalagmite in the center of 
the chamber may indicate the chamber had a special importance; indeed, the chamber was used as a trading post, indicated from the greek or latin graffiti scratched onto vessels reconstructed from various fragments and scraps of
finewears and ampharoae hidden in sediment or lying on the floor. Cups, plates, pitches, and jugs were also recovered; this is consistent with the chamber being a feast area.  


Bahn & Vertut chapter 5:
	Red ochre and other colours are used to paint things. Some musical instruments have survived the Upper Paleolithic, more specifically, 30 flutes spread throughout mostly Western Europe, but some in the East. A number of 
bone or ivory, with a hole at one end, have been interpreted as 'bull-roarers', a type of instrument which makes a loud humming noise when whirled around on a string; an example of this made of Reindeer Antler is from the cave
of La Roche Lalinde. One of the first forms of aesthetic expression in the Palaeolithic was body art. Lumps of pigments from archeological sites is evidence for such body paint used.

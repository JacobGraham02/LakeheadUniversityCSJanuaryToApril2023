Ciphers:
	
	Rail fence cipher - Transposition method cipher. Substituion involves mapping characters and numbers of the original message to some other characters and numbers. Transposition is reordering the original string of characters
to be in a different order. Plaintext written down as a sequence of diagonals are then read off as a sequence of rows. To encipher the message, "meet me after the toga party" wit hthe rail fence of depth 2, we would write: 
	

	Row transposition cipher - More complex transposition. Write the message in a rectangle, row by row, and read the message off, column by column, but permute the order of the columns. 


Steganography:
	Not an encryption scheme; hiding the extistance of a method.

 Symmetric encryption, asymmetric encryption, data integrity algorithms, authentication protocols. 

1) Conceal contents of blocks or streams of any sized data
2) Conceal small blocks of data such as encryption keys and hash function values. Used often in digital signatures
3) Protects blocks of data such as messages from alteration
4) Schemes based on the use of cryptographic algorithms designed to authenticate the identity of entities

Network and internet security consists of:
	Measures to deter, prevent, detect, and correct security violations that involve transmission of information. 


Computer Security objectives:
	Confidentiality:
		Data confidentiality - Assure that private information not made available to any unauthorized users
		Privacy - Assures individuals control or influence over information that may be collected and stored, and to whom that information is disclosed 

	Integrity:
		Data integrity - Assures that information and programs are changed only in a specified and authorized manner
		System integrity - Assures that a system performs its intended function in an unimpaired manner, free from unauthorized manipulation 

	Availability:
		Systems work promptly and service is not denied to authorized users. 



OSI security architecture:
	



Table 1.1 of threats and attacks:
	Threat:
		A potential for violation of security, which exists when there is a circumstance, capability, action, or event that could breach security and cause harm.
		That is, a possible danger that might exploit a vulnerability.

	Attack:
		An assault on system security that derives from an intelligent threat; that is, an intelligent act that is a deliberate attempt to evade security services
		and violate the security policy of a system. 

	
A passive attack attempts to learn or make use of information from the system but does not affect system resources
An active attack attempts to alter system resources ot affect their operation

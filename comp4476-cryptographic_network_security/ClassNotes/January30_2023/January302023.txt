Playfair cipher strategy:
		
	Suppose we have a 5x5 matrix with the keyword as 'MONARCHY'. 5x5 = 25 cells, and the alphabet has 26 letters. For the example word mosque, we will split up the word into 3 parts and create a diagram with those
	For mosque, we will create mo, sq, and use. 

	mo	sq	ue


	m o n a   r 
	c h y b   d
	e f g i/j k
	l p q s   t
    u v w x   z

	For each letter in the sequence of 2 letters, we must first determine if the 2 letters exist in the same row in the matrix. If they are in the same row, each letter can be converted to the letter directly to the right.
	For example, m can be converted to o, and o can be converted to n. If they are in the same column, you will use the letter directly below the one in question. For example, for el, e can be converted to l, and l can be 
	converted to u. If you need to convert u for example, you need to 'wrap around', and go to the top of the matrix. Therefore, u will be converted to m. 

	Strategy known as Playfair cipher. Best-known multiple-letter encryption cipher and based on the use of a 5x5 matrix of letters constructed using a keyword. 

	Always use the keyword 'monarchy' when constructing the 5x5 matrix, and fill in matrix letters from top left to bottom right.

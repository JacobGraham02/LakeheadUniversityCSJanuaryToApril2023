A classical AI problem : block world. 

Preconditions for picking up a block must ensure there is no block above the block selected. 

a) if the top block on the stack is removed, that block is now available for pickup and moved to a different location. The initial state is the starting 
point in a system. Actions are declared for the system, with each requiring a precondition and postcondition. The state in which we want to change the system
is called the goal state. We want to find the sequence of actions that must take place to convert the initial state into the goal state. Think intuitively
about how to reach the goal state. You have to look in state-space to search for a state that converts into a goal state.

b) We can represent a singular state as a node. An individual state can be changed into some other state. States drawn in a node diagram are related to each other.
Through applicable actions, if we can draw one state to another state, the states are considered linked. In one atomic action, you must be able to translate
between the two states. The enumeration of the states is a structure containing constant states in the system (data types, variables, etc.). Constraint extraction
and symmetry breaking. Symmetry breaking is ... . A deep space diagram is the diagram of all possible system states. In the deep state diagram, we want to find
the optimal path from the initial state to the goal state. We can sometimes get stuck in a 'dead loop', which is where a loop of states can constantly occur
over and over again. We must traverse through the deep space diagram and find the smallest number of states to achieve our goal state (lowest cost). A dead loop
instantly becomes an infinite number of steps. We use depth-first search and breadth-first search when iterating through the deep space diagram to find the
path of the least number of needed states to go from the initial state to the goal state; we use a stack and queue for this purpose. State space explosion is .... 

c) Tower of Hanoi can represent a state diagram going from the initial to the goal state. 

d) 8-puzzles can represent a state diagram going from the initial to the goal state. For each step in a collection of state diagrams, there are substeps
for each step.

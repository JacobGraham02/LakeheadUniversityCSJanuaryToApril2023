p(j, m, b, a, e) can be calculated by the product of the 5 
probabilities which has a probability to occur. 

= p(b) * p(e) * p(a|b,e) * p(j|a) * p(m|a)

j and m are dependent on a, and a is dependent on b and e. 

Determine the formula for the following:
p(j,m,b,not a, not e) = ?
	

p(j,m,b,a, not e)     = ?


p(j,m,b, not a, e)    = ?


Rejection sampling on the BN of Family/Dog:
	Sample from P(FO) = <0.15,0.85>, value is not fo
	Sample from P(LO|not fo) = <0.05, 0.95>, value is not lo
	Sample from P(BP) = <0.01,0.99> value is not bp
	Sample from P(DO|not fo, not bp) = <0.3,0.7>, value is do
	Sample from P(HB|do) = <0.7,0.3>, value is not hb

	In this case, the sample creates an event of:
	(not fo, not lo, not bp, do, not hb). 

Rejection sampling for estimating Pr(fo|lo, not hb)
	Pr(fo|lo, not hb) can actually be estimated as the ratio of:
	
	# of samples fo, lo, and not hb
	///////////////////////////////
	# of samples lo, and not hb

	= 336 / 668
	= 0.50299

	which is very close to the true value of 0.5005
	When the number of samples increases, the aprpoximation is
	getting closer to th exact value
	For example, when we run 1 million samples, the ratio is
	32996 / 65858 = 0.5010, which is even closer to 0.5005

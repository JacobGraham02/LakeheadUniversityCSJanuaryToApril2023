Basic concepts of assembly and computer systems:
	i) Welcome to assembly language ii) Virtual machine concept iii) Data representation iv) Boolean operations

	int y;
	int x = (y + 4) * 3

	mov eax, y			; Move y to the eax register
	add eax, 4			; Add 4 to the eax register
	mov ebx, 3			; Move 3 to the ebx register
	imul ebx			; Multiply eax by ebx
	mov x, eax			; Move eax to x

Each computer has a native machine language L0 that runs directly on the hardware
A more human-friendly language is usually constructed above machine language, called L1

Interpretation - L0 program interprets and executes L1 instructions one-by-one
Translation - L1 program is completely translated into an L0 program, which then runs on the computer hardware




English: Display the sum of A times B plus C

C++: cout << (A * B + C);

Assembly:
	mov eax, A
	mul B
	add eax, C
	call WriteInt

Intel Machine Language:
	A1 00000000
	F7 25 00000004

Specific machine levels
	Virtual machine VM1
	Virtual machine VM2


	Level 4 
		High-level language
		
		Application oriented language:
			C++, Java, Pascal, Visual Basic, etc.
		Programs compile into assembly language
	Level 3
		Assembly language
		
		Instruction mnemonics that have a one-to-one correspondence to machine language
		Programs are translated into instruction set architecture level - machine language (level 2)
	Level 2
		Instruction set architecture (ISA)
		Conventional machine language
		Executed by level 1 (Digital logic).
	Level 1
		CPU, constructed from digital logic gates
		Digital logic
		System bus
		Memory
		Implemented using bipolar transistor
